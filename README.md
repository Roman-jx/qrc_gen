ðŸ¤–What are QR codes

>A QR code is a type of barcode that can be read easily by a digital device and which stores information as a series of pixels in a square-shaped grid. QR >codes are frequently used to track information about products in a supply chain and â€“ because many smartphones have built-in QR readers â€“ they are often >used in marketing and advertising campaigns. More recently, they have played a key role in helping to trace coronavirus exposure and slow the spread of >the virus.

>The first QR code system was invented in 1994 by the Japanese company Denso Wave, a Toyota subsidiary. They needed a more accurate way to track vehicles >and parts during the manufacturing process. To achieve this, they developed a type of barcode that could encode kanji, kana, and alphanumeric characters.

>Standard barcodes can only be read in one direction â€“ top to bottom. That means they can only store a small amount of information, usually in an >alphanumeric format. But a QR code is read in two directions â€“ top to bottom and right to left. This allows it to house significantly more data.
